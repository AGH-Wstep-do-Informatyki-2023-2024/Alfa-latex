Beliefs about dragons vary considerably through regions, but dragons in Western cultures since the High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged, horned, and capable of breathing fire.
    Dragons in eastern cultures are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence.}
